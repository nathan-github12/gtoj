  Proof that computers have greatly benifittied the educational sector is the fact that the number of students enrolled in online universities cumulates to a total of
  over 20 million students. Enrolling in online universities allows people from around the world to study and attend their enrolled institutions from their homes,
  in whichever country they may be residing within. Some drabacks of this include the student becoming lazy, but this is the fault of the student and should not be
  blamed on the computer.
