Consistency of Quality of Visual Representation: Sound
There were a number of images throughout the site that added to the quality of the information and intrigued the reader. However, a couple of the pictures were poorly scaled and looked veyr stretched giving that section of the site a rushed look and took away from the profeessionalism of it. It is a minor problem however if fixed it would make a big impact on the site in making it look more professional and appleaing to the user.

Quality of Written Presentation: Excellent

As a whole, the written aspect of the site is clear and concise however there are a few areas where the wording of the information is overwhelwing and could be confusing to the reader. Again it is an easy fix however doing so will have a big impact on the reader as making the information more clear and concise will make it easier for the reader to absorb it therefore more likely to remember the information.

Validity of HTML: Perfect
As far as i can see, all of the HTML that has beeen included in the website is valid and i didnt run into any issues with it.

Evidence of collaboration: Very Good
Looking at the commits by each user, it is clear that there was collaboration on the project however some users contributed more than others in particular omar who appears to only have 1 commit.

When it comes to authoring, although the github pages for each of the authors of the site are linked, there is no information about the authors that has been written by another member of the team, which was one of the requirements for the project.

Aside from collaboration, a few of the commits were last minute as they were completed on the same day that it was due to be handed in. This could indicate that certain members forgot about the task or simply just decided to add something extra to improve the overall site.
